# L1 and L2 Regularization — Practice Project

This repository contains my **hands-on implementation** of **L1 (Lasso)** and **L2 (Ridge)** regularization techniques in linear regression using Python’s `scikit-learn` library.

I’m building this project as part of my **learning in public** journey — focusing on applying what I learn through practical experimentation, rather than just following tutorials.

---

## Practice Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Understand how **regularization** helps reduce overfitting.
- Explore the impact of the **alpha (λ)** parameter on model performance.
- Compare Ridge and Lasso regression results using a simple dataset.
- Visualize how model coefficients change with different alpha values.

## 📂 Repository Structure

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `L1_L2_regularization_practice.ipynb` | My main notebook — implementation, visualization, and evaluation of Ridge and Lasso regression. |
| `dataset.csv` | The dataset used for training and testing. *(Included if small enough)* |
| `dataset_generator.ipynb` | Code used to generate the dataset (for reproducibility). |
| `.gitignore` | Specifies files and folders (like `.ipynb_checkpoints`) that are not tracked by Git. |

## How to Run This 

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git git clone git@github.com:johankarkaria/L1_L2_regularization_practice.git
   cd L1_L2_regularization_practice
## Suggestion

I’m learning  in public — any **suggestions, improvements, or feedback** are always welcome!  
If you spot something that can be improved or want to share your thoughts, feel free to share your thought.I will be happy to that you care for me.
