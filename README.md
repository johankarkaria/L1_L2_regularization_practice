# L1 and L2 Regularization â€” Practice Project

This repository contains my **hands-on implementation** of **L1 (Lasso)** and **L2 (Ridge)** regularization techniques in linear regression using Pythonâ€™s `scikit-learn` library.

Iâ€™m building this project as part of my **learning in public** journey â€” focusing on applying what I learn through practical experimentation, rather than just following tutorials.

---

## Practice Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Understand how **regularization** helps reduce overfitting.
- Explore the impact of the **alpha (Î»)** parameter on model performance.
- Compare Ridge and Lasso regression results using a simple dataset.
- Visualize how model coefficients change with different alpha values.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `L1_L2_regularization_practice.ipynb` | My main notebook â€” implementation, visualization, and evaluation of Ridge and Lasso regression. |
| `dataset.csv` | The dataset used for training and testing. *(Included if small enough)* |
| `dataset_generator.ipynb` | Code used to generate the dataset (for reproducibility). |
| `.gitignore` | Specifies files and folders (like `.ipynb_checkpoints`) that are not tracked by Git. |
